# Animal posture detection

In this Model we are taking the live video of animals from a wide angle camera. The camera is a raspberry pi module which will be attached to the Raspberry Pi 4. We used tried different methods for animal classification first one-shot detection, second transfer learning using VGG-16, Resnet-50 as per the outputs we selected Transfer learning using Resnet-50 as this was showing good accuracy.We implemented classification for four classes, i.e cat, dog, panda and elephant. For pose estimation we used DeepLab Cut which shows helps in determining what animals are doing in their daily routine. All the results of the live video is then send to the server which can be used whenever required.Further we will make a user friendly Android Application which will be helpful for the owner of the zoo, or any animal care takers to keep an eye via their Mobiles from any location.
